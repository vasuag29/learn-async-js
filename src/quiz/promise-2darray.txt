Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

This code defines a function called sum2DArray which takes a 2-dimensional array as input, 
calculates the sum of all elements in the array, and returns a promise. 
Inside the promise, there's a timeout function simulating an asynchronous operation. 
If the input is a valid array, it calculates the sum and resolves the promise with the sum. 
If the input is not an array, it rejects the promise with a message indicating bad input.

The code then demonstrates the usage of the sum2DArray function by creating two instances of promises, 
sumPromise1 and sumPromise2, with different inputs. sumPromise1 is created with a valid 2-dimensional array, 
so it should resolve with the sum of its elements. sumPromise2 is created with a string instead of an array, 
so it should reject with a message indicating bad input. Both promises are then chained with .then() and .catch() handlers 
to handle the resolution and rejection accordingly. Finally, the promises along with their states are logged to the console.
