Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.
1. "Sum called ... " indicates the beginning of the sum2DArray() function execution. This gets logged in the main thread. 
2. "returning from sum" suggests the function execution reaches the end of the sum2DArray() function block,
3. "rejecting ... " appears when the input parameter provided to sum2DArray() is not an array. This appears before the execution of
    sumPromise1 because it is faster to reject an invalid input, in this case sumPromise2. 
4. "returning from sum" appears again after the rejection handling block.
5. "Sum called ... " is logged again when sum2DArray() is called with 'array2D'.
6. "resolving ... " is logged when the promise is resolved with a valid input array.
7. "Sum Promise 1: 45" shows the successful resolution of the promise with the correct sum value.
8. "Sum Promise 2 Error: BAD INPUT: Expected array as input" is logged due to rejection of the 
    promise when an invalid input is provided. In our case, we passed a string instead of an array.
